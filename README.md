# Face-Filters
In this piece of work I have tried to implement face_filter on a live video feed. We make use of OpenCv to detect face and impelment the filter on the face. 
There are two ways in which i ahev done this project. One by simply creating a jupytor notebook where i detect face and implement filters individually.
Second method is where i make use of FLASK to create a web app which uses the module structure of the code and uses base.html for the layout.
