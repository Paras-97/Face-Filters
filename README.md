# Face-Filters
In this piece of work I have tried to implement neon_filter on a live video feed. We make use of OpenCv to detect face and impelment the filter on the face. Further work will be done on this where I will be implementing the puppy and witch filter. 
I plan to create a piece of code in VS where i will be implementing them in an organised format. This code over here is just a rough implementation.
